\section*{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\noindent
\textbf{Trainee Decision Scientist, Innovation \& Development Labs \hfill June 2015 - March 2016}\\
Mu Sigma, Bangalore, India
\begin{itemize}
	\item Led a 3 member group to research, prototype and test Computer Vision
        algorithms for Image Recognition and Tracking, as part of a video analytics solution created for a major US retailer
    \item Developed a HoG based person detector with 90\% recall
	\item Developed and maintained a multi-user, distributed testing framework for object
detection algorithms that generated automated reports for consumption by stakeholders
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Trainee Decision Scientist, Client Services \hfill July 2014 - June 2015}\\
Mu Sigma, Bangalore, India
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assisted the analytics division of a Fortune-500 Insurance firm
        develop and maintain predictive models to detect fraud. Used Text
        Mining and Ensemble Learning for state of the art performance and savings of \$3M+
	\item Spearheaded a project to create an analytical database comprised of 3 years worth of claims. Resolved several data discrepancies which led to 
        overall improvements in the data collection process
    \item Led a 2 member team to integrate third-party information
        with in-house data. Shaved 70\% of the time taken to parse the
        proprietary data format by automating the process with Python
	\item Ensured consistent delivery of weekly model runs across 3 LOBs and quick turnaround of ad-hoc analyses
	\item Completed a time-critical port of existing production SAS codes from Windows to Unix, creating a
comprehensive catalog of the differences which went on to be used for other projects
	\item Picked up new techniques unfamiliar to the team, and applied them under tight deadlines- web scraping,
topic modeling, geocoding and fuzzy matching
	\item Conducted training sessions for new team members on Python and its data science stack
\end{itemize}
