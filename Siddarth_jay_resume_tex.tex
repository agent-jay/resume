\section*{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\noindent
\textit{Trainee Decision Scientist, Innovation \& Development Labs, Mu Sigma Pvt. Ltd.\hfill June 2015 - March 2016}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Led a 3 member team to research, prototype and test Computer Vision algorithms for human motion
tracking, as part of a video analytics solution created for a major US retailer
	\item Developed and maintained a multi-user, distributed testing framework for measuring the accuracy of object
detection algorithms, and coupled it with an automated report for consumption by stakeholders
	\item Integrated 2 Internet-of-Things prototypes based on the RaspberryPi platform, with an in-house streaming agent-based platform with quick turnaround in preparation for Scipy 2015, a popular tech conference
\end{itemize}
\textit{Trainee Decision Scientist, Client Services, Mu Sigma Pvt. Ltd \hfill July 2014 - June 2015}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assisted the analytics division of a Fortune-500 Insurance firm develop and maintain predictive models to detect fraud. Used Text Mining and Ensemble Learning for improved accuracy
	\item Spearheaded a project to create a consolidated database of 3 years worth of claims and resolve several
data discrepancies that had accumulated over time
	\item Led a 2 member team to integrate third-party information with in-house data. Shaved 70\% of the time taken
to parse the complex structure of the data by automating the process with Python
	\item Ensured consistent delivery of model runs across 3 LOBs and quick turnaround of ad-hoc analyses
	\item Completed a time-critical port of existing production SAS codes from Windows to Unix, creating a
comprehensive catalog of the differences which went on to be used for other projects
	\item Picked up new techniques unfamiliar to the team, and applied them under tight deadlines- web scraping,
topic modeling, geocoding and fuzzy matching
	\item Conducted training sessions for new team members on Python and its data science stack
\end{itemize}
